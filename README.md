### This game is in active development. Some features (like pause, etc) haven't been added yet. Yes, it isn't playable, but I promise it will be. Be patient!


# Sushi Cats

Hey there! Welcome to Sushi Cats! This game is all about **rollin'**. 

You are now in Mrs. Sea's house. She's such a cat lady! You have to take care of *alllllll* of her cats. Difficult task, isn't it?

However, in her own words, her cats "love to snuggle up in all sorts of blankets, and don't care where or when, they'll fall asleep". 
Your goal now is to roll up these cats in fluffy blankets, right before Mrs. Ocean arrives!

## Controls:

Right arrow key: roll the cat up in a blanket.

P: Pause. [TODO]

M: Toggle music. [TODO]

- Even though the game isn't finished, I still decided to share it. This year's theme was **on a roll**. It was my first game jam ever and I learned a lot! Hopefully I will upload
something complete next jam. Check out the amazing submissions by the most talented devs at the [jam page](https://itch.io/jam/haxejam-2021-winter-edition/entries)! :heart:
